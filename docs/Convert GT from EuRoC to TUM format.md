### Convert GT from EuRoC to TUM format

Use a Python script to:

1. Select: `timestamp, t_x, t_y, t_z, q_x, q_y, q_z, q_w`
2. Convert timestamp from nanoseconds to seconds
3. Sync with estimated trajectory timestamps (rounded to 3 decimal places)
4. Save as `mh123_gt_tum_synced.txt`

```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df_gt = pd.read_csv("mh123_gt.csv", comment="#", header=None)

df_est = pd.read_csv("mh123_est_gba.csv", sep=' ', header=None)

df_gt[0] = pd.to_numeric(df_gt[0], errors='coerce') / 1e9

df_tum = df_gt[[0,1,2,3,5,6,7,4]]  # note: qw ×”×•×œ×š ×‘×¡×•×£

df_tum["rounded_time"] = df_tum[0].round(3)
df_est["rounded_time"] = df_est[0].round(3)

df_synced = df_tum[df_tum["rounded_time"].isin(df_est["rounded_time"])].drop(columns=["rounded_time"])

df_synced.to_csv("mh123_gt_tum_synced.txt", sep=' ', header=False, index=False)
```

The spatial APE plots show that most of the estimated trajectory maintains low error (2â€“7 cm), especially in the central segments. However, local spikes in error are visible at trajectory edges, often due to abrupt motion or visually ambiguous regions. The time-based APE graph confirms this consistency, with the mean and RMSE around 5â€“6 cm and only a few short-lived deviations. These results suggest good global alignment, but with room for improvement in handling challenging regions (e.g., by enhancing visual tracking or incorporating loop closures).
